The vast range of unmanned aircraft necessitates a comprehensive and suitable risk assessment. We
propose the use of a risk map to characterize the risk associated with unmanned aircraft [uncontrolled
descent occurrences, drone parameters, environmental conditions, and parameter uncertainties]. The
risk that aircraft activities over a specific area pose to the general public is calculated by this threedimensional location-based map. A probabilistic method is utilized to construct the risk map, which
includes numerous layers such as obstacles, no-fly zones, population density, and sheltering factor.
The risk of flying over a specific area is measured by the risk value assigned to each component of
the risk map. A risk assessment procedure that considers environmental variables, drone parameters,
uncontrolled descent events, and parameter uncertainties defines.
The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, is expanding rapidly
across various sectors, including logistics, surveillance, agriculture, and disaster management. This
project focuses on the development of efficient and reliable path planning algorithms for drones
operating Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)â€”a critical capability for enabling autonomous
long-range operations. Simulations are conducted in dynamic environments to evaluate performance
under real-world conditions including variable weather, no-fly zones, and moving obstacles. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating safe, efficient, and
regulatory-compliant flight paths, thereby contributing to the advancement of autonomous drone
operations in BVLOS scenarios
